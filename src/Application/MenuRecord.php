 * is how a site's presentation contract names the menu it draws as primary navigation without
 * embedding a generated identifier in a theme. The record itself holds no items; ask
 * `NavigationRepository::items()` for those. `version` is the optimistic-locking counter that an
 * update or delete must quote back, so a stale administrator screen cannot overwrite a newer edit.
