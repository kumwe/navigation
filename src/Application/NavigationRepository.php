 * cascading path rewrite live here because they need set-based access to the stored tree, and doing
 * them in the store keeps `NavigationService` free of a full in-memory tree load on every edit. Every
 * mutation takes the `version` the caller read and refuses when the stored row has moved on, so an
 * implementation must make that check part of the same statement rather than a read followed by a
 * write. Reads are unfiltered: site scoping and capability checks belong to the callers above.
